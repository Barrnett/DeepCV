# DeepCV

[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions)]
## Introduction
DeepCV is mainly a collection of some current classical and popular networks in the field of computer vision, including target detection, image segmentation, image classification, etc.

The main goals of DeepCV:

Easy to use, newbies can get hands dirty with deep learning quickly
Good performance with web-scale data
Easy to extend, Modular architecture let you build your Neural network like playing LEGO!
Let's Get Started!
