# EffectiveCtr

# Introduction
The EffectiveCtr library offers state-of-the-art algorithms for [deep learning recommendation]. EffectiveCtr is built on latest [TensorFlow 2][(https://tensorflow.org/)] and designed with modular structureï¼Œ making it easy to discover patterns and answer questions about tabular-structed data.

The main goals of EffectiveCtr:

Easy to use, newbies can get hands dirty with deep learning quickly
Good performance with web-scale data
Easy to extend, Modular architecture let you build your Neural network like playing LEGO!
Let's Get Started!
